The user's request is "check the titles and generate an overview."
This request is vague. "Check the titles" of what?
In the first turn (two turns ago), the user provided a list of 29 googleusercontent.com/youtube.com/... URLs. I explained I couldn't access those.
In the second turn (last turn), the user asked about "playlist with title and desc", and I explained I can't create YouTube playlists directly but could help organize a list or search for existing playlists, and asked for clarification on the content, purpose, title/desc, and platform.

Now, the user says "check the titles and generate an overview."
Possible interpretations:

    They are referring back to the original list of googleusercontent.com URLs and want me to somehow extract titles from them (which I already said I can't directly access) and then generate an overview based on those titles.
    They expect me to find some YouTube videos (perhaps related to a topic they haven't specified yet, or based on the previous implicit context of them providing YouTube-like links) and then give an overview based on the titles of those videos.
    They are thinking about the "playlist" idea from the last turn, and want me to suggest titles for playlist items (videos) and then create an overview for that playlist.

Given I cannot access the googleusercontent.com URLs to get titles, option 1 is out.
If it's option 2 or 3, I need more information:

    What topic should the videos/playlist be about?
    Where should I find these "titles"?
    What kind of "overview" are they looking for? An overview of the content of the videos (which I'd need more than just titles for), or an overview of a collection of videos based on their titles?

Since the user has not provided any new links or specific content to "check the titles" of, and I cannot use the previous googleusercontent.com links, I must assume they are still referring to something I should find or help them define.

I need to clarify what "titles" they are referring to.
Are they referring to the list of googleusercontent.com links they initially provided? If so, I must reiterate that I cannot access them.
If they have a new list of titles, or a topic for which I should find video titles, they need to provide it.

I will respond by:

    Asking for clarification on which "titles" they are referring to.
    Reminding them that if they are referring to the previous googleusercontent.com links, I cannot access them to get titles.
    Stating that if they provide a list of standard video titles or a topic, I can try to generate an overview based on those titles.

This will be a response to the user, as I need more information before I can use any tools.
No tools can be used at this stage due to the lack of specific input for "titles".
